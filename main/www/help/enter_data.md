* Use the  button <a class="btn btn-xs btn-primary type=button"> <i class="fa fa-feather" role="presentation"></i> <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-triangle-bottom"></span> </a> for Saving data.  

* When you hover over column names, you'll see descriptions of each column and hints on how to enter the data. Additionally, you can refer to the Columns Definitions section to understand the description of each column.

* Once the data is entered click <kbd>SAVE</kbd> and the new data will be uploaded to the database.

* The data is checked before uploading, so if there are any issues, check the <kbd>DATA ENTRY ISSUES</kbd>. If there are still issues that cannot be solved, change the <kbd>VALIDATION</kbd> to <kbd>OFF</kbd>, and perhaps write in the comments why you bypassed the data validation.

*  After saving the data, you can either exit the page or start a new session. When you're ready to exit the page, your browser may display a warning saying 'Changes you made may not be saved.' Simply ignore this and press 'Leave.' This additional check is in place to ensure you don't accidentally close the data entry spreadsheet.
